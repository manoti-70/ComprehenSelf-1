## Short description

### What's the problem?

In the post covid world, many people are losing jobs and facing mental health issues like depression,anxiety etc.

### How can technology help?

Chatbots are the state-of-the-art method to talk to people about various issues ranging from technical help in websites to acting as language translators. 

### The idea

We understand that mental health is a private discussion and hence we have included login feature in our app. upon logging in, the chatbot talks to the person, knows their problem and gives them a fix or asks them to consult a doctor if it understands that the person is having extreme symptoms.

## The architecture

1. Upon starting the app, the user is asked to login.
2. A new user has to click on sign up and sign up by filling in the details. A verification link is sent to the user's email id and the user has to verify it by      clicking on it.
3. The user can now login with these credentials.
4. The user is now interfaced with the chatbot and can interact via text/speech.
5. Watson Speech to Text processes the audio and extracts the text in case the user chooses to speak.
6. The bot replies to the user and the conversation goes on.
